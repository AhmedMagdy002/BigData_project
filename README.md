# BigData_project
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using PySpark. It analyzes a dataset of tweets and classifies them into positive and negative sentiments. The project compares three machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. Each model is tested with and without stemming.
